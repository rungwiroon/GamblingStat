## Gambling?
Yes, gambling because my friend wants some program to predict next turn of cabara's result.
And I see it was pretty easy to understand and implement.
So I decided to implement it with many new frameworks and libraries, that I've never used before.

## What are already implemented

  * A functional programming library for C#.
* Stateless library
  * A state machine libray for .net.
* Blazor
  * A C# frontend framework using WebAssembly.
* GUI
  * Old legacy windows form.

## Todo
### Frontend
* Blazor
  * Bootstap
  * Component
* Local DB

### Backend
* YesSQL	
  * SQLite
  * PostgresSQL
* ORM
  * EF Core
* NoSQL
  * MongoDB
* Language-ext
  * Curry Function
  * Partial Application
* GUI
  * .net core 3.0
